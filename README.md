# Modern UI Cards by [@lupinglade](https://github.com/cyaneous) 

This is an early version of a clean, modern custom card set for Home Assistant that is optimized for use with touch panels/tablets. Intended to be used with the Graphite theme, though other themes should work fine too.

## Installation

Install via HACS or add as a resource to your dashboard.
